Shopware 6 CMS Element for adding buttons to your layout in an editor

## After Installation
CLI:
bin/build-administration.sh
bin/build-storefront.sh
bin/console cache:clear

Now you see a new CMS Element in your Layout Elements.
After adding this element to any layout, you get an additional editor unter the label "Subs".
Now, another editor is available in your layout. Here, you simply add text, which you can turn into links using the linking tool. For each additional button you want, press Enter once and then add another link. All of these links will be converted into buttons in the storefront.
